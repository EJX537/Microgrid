## Source Code Conventions

Source code should be formatted with ``black`` using a maximum line-length
of 79 characters.  Black can be installed with ``pip install black``.
If the resulting output is inadequate for some reason, such as manually
formatted data tables, you can make judicious use of ``# fmt: off`` and
``# fmt: on`` to disable formatting for the relevant lines.

Source code should be syntax checked with pylint.  Pylint can be
installed with ``pip install pylint``.  You can make judicious use
of ``# pylint: disable=``\ *warning-name* to temporarily disable
warnings that can safely be ignored.
